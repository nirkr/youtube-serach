## Youtube project

Project was build with nextJS

* install dependencies: npm i

* run the development server: npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

* the app shows cards with song info. 

* Didn't find simple api, all with authentication => used the data as local file

* clicking on each card sends the user to relevant path (still need to build that)

* search bar was built - need still to fix few bugs implementing it
